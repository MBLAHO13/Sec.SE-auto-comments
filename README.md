# Sec.SE-auto-comments

As a follow-up on [this Sec.SE meta][1], I have scraped the auto comments from [the SOCVR][2] room's [github][3] and tailored them to be of use on [Sec.SE][3].

The result is to be used with the [auto-comments][5] userscript/plugin. It allows to easily post helpful comments, especially for new users.

I'd be happy for a ping in [the Sec.SE CVR room][6] or a pull request for contributions - or any feedback.

I will also post a meta in a week from now to allow for helpful additions, comments and such to be added until then.

The comments are in a raw format so you can copy&paste them into the "import/export" window of the userscript. Click the "auto" button and then "import/export", paste it there and hit "save".
